                    <p><a href="https://wovenmagazine.com/">Woven Magazine</a>: I like the use of a large background image on the homepage and the overall simplicity of the site's layout. I also like the black, white, and grey color scheme.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/08/arts/asian-american-photos-love.html">New York Times: Keeping Love Close</a>: I like the use of different fonts and font sizes as well as the layering of images.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a>: The  layering of animation and text on the homepage is bold and impactful.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/02/15/saving-the-butterfly-forest">The New Yorker: Saving the Butterfly Forest</a>: This story uses animations and scrolling transitions to incorporate multimedia into the print story. I like the variety of different layouts and the stark contrast between the black background and the white text. </p>
                    <p><a href="https://studiorotate.com/">Studio Rotate</a>: With the simple homepage, the placement and orientation of the menu button, and the interesting display of the menu page, this website is innovative and unique.</p>
